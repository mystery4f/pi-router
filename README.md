- Decision logging, latency tracking, and health monitoring
- Footer status showing the active provider channel
- Interactive menus and tab completion for all commands
- Interactive configuration wizard
- Fast startup with lazy loading and caching

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
# From npm (after publication)
pi install npm:pi-router

# Or from GitHub
pi install git:github.com/jiangge/pi-router

# Or from local directory (for development)
pi install /path/to/pi-router
```

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for detailed installation options. The current development version targets pi `0.84.4+` and Node.js `22.19+`.

### 2. Configure

Recommended: run the interactive wizard.

```bash
/router config wizard
```

The wizard walks through:

1. Routing strategy (`channelFirst` / `custom`)
2. Sort strategy (`latency` / `capabilityFirst` / `cost` / `manual`)
3. Auto-sync (`enable` recommended / `disable`)
4. Health probe (`disabled` recommended / `10 minutes`)
5. Sticky mode (`enable` / `disable`)
6. Optional channel order adjustment

**Channel Classification**: The wizard automatically classifies channels into three categories:

- 🔵 **OAuth** (Official) - Official API endpoints from AI providers (e.g., `api.anthropic.com`, `api.deepseek.com`)
- 🟡 **Aggregator** (Third-party) - Third-party aggregation services
- 🟢 **Free** (Local) - Local deployments and free services

Classification is based on:
- `auth.json` OAuth markers (`type: "oauth"`)
- Official domain whitelist (40+ providers including Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, DeepSeek, Qwen, GLM, Kimi, and more)
- Local URL detection (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`)

Configuration is stored at the same agent directory used by pi:

```text
~/.pi/agent/pi-router.json
```

If `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` is set, pi-router reads and writes `models.json`, `auth.json`, and `pi-router.json` under that directory instead.

Advanced users can edit the file directly. A companion file is also generated:

```text
~/.pi/agent/pi-router.README.md
```

A reference example is available at [examples/router.config.json](examples/router.config.json).

### 3. Use

In pi, select the Auto Router model:

```text
/model router/auto
```

This routes all requests through pi-router automatically, using your configured strategy and model chain.

You can also select a specific model with routing:

```text
/model router/your-model-id
```

pi-router will then:

- try channels in order (based on strategy)
- fail over on errors
- apply circuit breaker and cooldown rules
- optionally fall back to another model
- record health and latency information
- display the active channel in the footer (e.g., `via anthropic`)
- remember the last successful route for next time (sticky mode)

## Commands

Run `/router` without arguments to open an interactive menu, or use tab completion.

### Configuration

```text
/router config wizard    # Interactive configuration wizard
/router config order     # Adjust existing model/channel order only
/router config show      # Show current configuration
/router config reset     # Reset to default configuration
```

Shortcuts:

```text
/router config w         # = wizard
/router config o         # = order
/router config s         # = show
/router config r         # = reset
```

### Monitoring

```text
/router status           # Show config summary
/router list             # List configured router models
/router explain          # Show failures, latency, health, circuits
/router decisions        # Show recent routing decisions
/router probes           # Show background health probe results
/router pricing          # Show per-channel pricing breakdown
```

### Sticky Routing

```text
/router sticky           # Show current sticky routing records
/router sticky clear     # Clear all sticky records (re-route from beginning)
/router sticky clear <m> # Clear sticky record for a specific model
/router reset            # Reset routing pointer to chain index 0 (sticky + active channel + cooldowns + circuits + failures)
/router reset auto       # Same, scoped to the auto chain
/router reset <m>        # Same, scoped to one model (persists across /reload)
```

### Management

```text
/router sync             # Check models.json and auth-only builtin changes
/router sync accept      # Apply detected model changes
/router diff             # Preview config differences
```

`/router sync` syncs providers and models explicitly declared in `models.json`,
plus builtin models for authenticated providers that appear only in `auth.json`.
Providers explicitly declared with `models: []` stay disabled. Deprecated models
are filtered silently.

## How It Works

### Auto Router (`router/auto`)

When you select `router/auto`, pi-router manages the full model chain:

```text
User Request: router/auto
    ↓
Check sticky record → found "model-X@channel-Y"?
    ↓ yes                    ↓ no
Try sticky first         Follow strategy order
    ↓ fail                   ↓
Clear sticky, fall back to strategy order
    ↓
channelFirst: Model-A[ch1,ch2,ch3] → Model-B[ch1,ch2] → ...
custom:       explicit model@channel order from customOrder
    ↓
On success: update sticky record, stream response
    ↓
Footer shows: via <channel-name>
```

### Same model, different providers

Example:

```text
Try channels: Provider-A -> Provider-B -> Provider-C
```

Typical flow:

```text
User Request: router/example-model
    ↓
Router intercepts
    ↓
Try Provider-A -> Provider-B -> Provider-C
- check cooldown
- check circuit breaker
- forward to real provider
- on error: record failure, try next
    ↓
If all channels fail, try fallback model
    ↓
Stream events back to user
```

### Sticky Mode

Sticky mode remembers the last successful route and tries it first on next request:

```text
Request 1: Provider-A succeeds → sticky = Provider-A
Request 2: Provider-A tried first → succeeds
Request 3: Provider-A fails → clear sticky, try Provider-B → succeeds → sticky = Provider-B
Request 4: Provider-B tried first
...
(Persists across pi restarts)
```

Use `/router sticky clear` to reset and re-route from the beginning.

### Circuit Breaker

```text
Failures: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 (open)
    ↓
Block requests for a cooldown window
    ↓
Half-open: allow a test request
    ↓
Success -> closed
Failure -> open again
```

### Context Transfer

When switching models:

1. `summary` mode: summarize the conversation
2. sanitize incompatible context fields if needed
3. forward the adapted context to the fallback model

## Configuration Reference

### Main File

```text
~/.pi/agent/pi-router.json
```

### Typical Configuration

```json
{
  "strategy": "channelFirst",
  "sortBy": "latency",
  "autoSync": true,
  "sticky": true,
  "healthProbe": {
    "enabled": false
  },
  "models": [
    {
      "id": "example-model",
      "channels": ["Provider-A", "Provider-B", "Provider-C"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Global Options

```json
{
  "strategy": "channelFirst",
  "auto": true,
  "sortBy": "latency",
  "autoSync": true,
  "sticky": true,
  "request": {
    "timeoutMs": 120000,
    "maxRetries": 0,
    "maxRetryDelayMs": 1000,
    "maxTokens": 32768
  },
  "footer": {
    "rightAlignRoute": true,
    "statusLine": true
  },
  "contextTransfer": "summary",
  "summaryModel": "optional-summary-model",
  "summaryPrompt": "optional custom prompt",
  "summaryMaxTokens": 2000,
  "failover": {
    "cooldownMs": 60000
  },
  "healthProbe": {
    "enabled": false,
    "intervalMs": 600000,
    "timeoutMs": 10000,
    "probeMessage": "Red, green, yellow — just tell me which color you like best."
  }
}
```

Background feature defaults:

- `autoSync` defaults to `true`. It only checks local `models.json`/`auth.json` changes and prompts you to sync; it does not run health probes or call model providers.
- `healthProbe.enabled` defaults to `false` and is the only switch for background health checks. If set to `true`, pi-router periodically sends the configured `probeMessage` to real upstream models (for example every `intervalMs` milliseconds). These are real API calls and may create extra usage/costs.
- `healthProbe.probeMessage` must be longer than 10 characters. Some third-party channels reject very short messages (e.g. `"ping"`) as liveness probes. If your configured value is missing or too short, pi-router falls back to a safe default automatically.
- `debug: true` appends routing decisions, per-attempt latencies and raw upstream errors to `router-<date>.log` inside `logDir` (default `~/pi-data/pi-router/logs`). Use it to diagnose unexpected failovers (a "healthy" model being switched away, all-routes-exhausted errors). Alternatively set the `PI_ROUTER_DEBUG=1` environment variable for console output. `/router explain` shows the effective debug status and log directory.

Footer defaults:

- `footer.rightAlignRoute` defaults to `true`: while router status is active, pi-router replaces pi's footer so route status can be right-aligned
- set `footer.rightAlignRoute` to `false` to keep pi's built-in footer layout
- `footer.statusLine` defaults to `true`: when the replacement footer is disabled, pi-router still shows a short built-in status item
- set `footer.statusLine` to `false` to suppress that fallback status item

### Summary AI Behavior

Default behavior:

- `summaryModel` is not required
- if the current context still fits inside the selected target model's context window, pi-router skips summary generation and forwards the full context
- when a summary is needed and `summaryModel` is unset, pi-router first uses the target model for summary generation
- if AI summary generation fails, pi-router falls back to a plain text non-AI summary path
- `summaryMaxTokens` defaults to `2000`

Optional dedicated summary AI configuration:

```json
{
  "contextTransfer": "summary",
  "summaryModel": "cheap-summary-model",
  "summaryPrompt": "Summarize the conversation for model handoff.",
  "summaryMaxTokens": 2000
}
```

`summaryModel` supports either:

- `model-id`
- `model-id@provider`

### Per-Model Options

```json
{
  "id": "example-model",
  "aliases": ["Example-Model", "proxy/example-model"],
  "channels": ["Provider-A", "Provider-B"],
  "modelByChannel": {
    "Provider-B": "proxy/example-model"
  },
  "sticky": true,
  "sortBy": "latency",
  "contextTransfer": "summary",
  "fallbackModels": [
    {
      "id": "fallback-model",
      "channels": ["Provider-A", "Provider-B"]
    }
  ],
  "failover": {
    "cooldownMs": 30000
  }
}
```

Alias fields let one router-facing canonical model group provider-specific upstream model IDs without editing `models.json`:

- `id` is the canonical `router/<id>` model selected in Pi
- `aliases` lists upstream model IDs considered equivalent for sync/grouping
- `modelByChannel[channel]` is the exact upstream model ID to send to that provider when it differs from `id`
- if no `modelByChannel` entry exists, pi-router tries `id` and then aliases for that channel

If the same provider exposes both the canonical upstream ID and a variant ID, use `routes` so both entries can be sorted independently:

```json
{
  "id": "example-model",
  "aliases": ["proxy/example-model"],
  "routes": [
    { "channel": "Provider-B" },
    { "channel": "Provider-B", "model": "proxy/example-model" }
  ]
}
```

The config/order UI displays the second entry as `Provider-B (proxy/example-model)` but saves the structured route, not the display label. Custom strategy also supports `customRoutes` for these duplicate-provider route entries.

pi-router also exposes active routes through the optional `Symbol.for("pi.routing.registry.v1")` protocol and reads optional cache hints from `Symbol.for("pi.cache.hints.v1")`. This keeps integrations with cache/status extensions protocol-based while preserving true upstream assistant message metadata for cache statistics.

### Manual Editing

You can edit `~/.pi/agent/pi-router.json` directly.

After editing:

```text
/reload
```

or restart pi.

## Performance

pi-router is optimized for fast startup with minimal overhead.

### Startup Optimization

- smart file hash caching
- lazy loading of `models.json`
- deferred health probe startup
- reduced duplicate file I/O

### Typical Improvement

| Scenario | Before | After | Improvement |
|----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Hot cache | ~50-80ms | ~5-15ms | ~80% |
| Cold cache | ~50-80ms | ~30-50ms | ~40% |
| autoSync disabled | ~30-50ms | ~5-10ms | ~80% |
| healthProbe disabled | ~40-60ms | ~5-15ms | ~75% |
